      We will write an essay here (I promise, again!) “Counterintuition requires us to think beyond our comfort zone, to think oppositions in tandem, and to think them in a different grammar—not the grammar of the declarative (“this is”), but in the grammar of my favorite tense: the subjunctive tense of the future real conditional. It is not a provisional tense, but one premised on the realization of a different future. It is the tense of “as if.” It is an intentional deployment of aspiration that strives toward a multitude of possibilities.” (Campt 23).
