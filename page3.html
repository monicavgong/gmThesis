      Amin, Kadji. “Haunted by the 1990s: Queer Theory’s Affective Histories.” WSQ: Women’s
        Studies Quarterly, vol. 44, no. 3 & 4, 2016, pp. 173-189.
        <br>“Haunted by the 1990s: Queer Theory’s Affective Histories” traces the deployment of the word “queer” from its acceptance into the academy during the 1990s to its varying uses, affects, and political engagements in contemporary culture. Amin guides our current definition of “queer”: “the product of . . . dense affective histories undergoing chemical reactions with new contexts . . . recontextualizing itself within new racialized and geopolitical landscapes” (Amin 186).

        Daisies. Directed by Věra Chytilová, Filmové studio Barrandov, 1966.
        <br>Daisies (1996) depicts two spoiled girls mirroring a spoiled world. Like Marie I and Marie II, we aim to engage with institutions in a way that serves us—traversing through chaos to break apart, collect, arrange, collage, and manipulate disparate parts into a new whole.

        Glissant Édouard. “For Opacity.” Poetics of Relation, translated by Betsy Wing, University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, 2021, pp. 189–194.
        <br>Glissant argues that in Western epistemologies the precondition for comprehension is transparency. For Glissant, the process by which one is made transparent is necessarily reductive, proposing instead the reclamation of opacity as liberatory and collective practice.

        Haraway, Donna. “A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the
        Late Twentieth Century.” Internet Archive Wayback Machine, Routledge, 2012,
        web.archive.org/web/20120214194015/www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Haraway/CyborgMa
        Nifesto.html.
        <br>“A Cyborg Manifesto” in part argues for the construction of a political subjectivity modeled after a cyborg: “a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as science fiction” (Haraway 149). Haraway champions the cyborg as an expression of the permeability of identity, of experience, of dichotomies and of embodiment. This comes as a critique to political subjectivities mobilized around all static notions of identity.

        Ho, Christopher K., and Daisy Nam, editors. Best! Letters from Asian Americans in the arts.
        Paper Monument, 2021.
        <br>Best! Letters from Asian Americans in the arts provides us with an example of a research-based anthology which centers shared affect and community as methods of survival during moments of sociopolitical visibility and upheaval.

        Morton, Timothy. “The Age of Asymmetry.” Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology After the End of the World, University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 2021, pp. 159–201.
        <br>Facing the waste of late-stage capitalism [climate disaster, chronic economic precarity, and the impotency of phallocentric Western modes of knowing], Morton proposes the hyperobject as the incomprehensible and massively distributed products of human activity. Morton argues that in order for humans to address these issues, we must realize our entrenchment and cultivate new modes of militancy.

        Russell, Legacy. Glitch Feminism: A Manifesto. London UK, Verso, 2020.
        <br>Glitch Feminism: A Manifesto outlines various methodologies to subvert (i.e. glitch) binaries. Although Russell’s ideas focus on an intersection of gender and technology, they can be readjusted and applied to adjacent, mirroring, or overlapping systems under contemporary capitalism.

        Sedgwick, Eve Kosofsky. “Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading, or, You’re So Paranoid,
        <br>You Probably Think This Essay Is About You.” Touching Feeling: Affect, Pedagogy, Performativity, Duke University Press, 2003, pp. 123-152.
	       “Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading” delineates a hegemony within critical studies which privileges “paranoid reading”: a pattern of knowledge-making which is anticipatory, is reflexive and mimetic, centers negative affect, and places faith in exposure. Sedgwick argues for “reparative reading” practices—often stemming from or building off paranoid reading practices—a method of approach that is open, is mutable and experimental, looks for positive affect, and places faith in generative practices.

         TallBear, Kim, and Angela Willey. “Introduction: Critical Relationality: Queer, Indigenous, and Multispecies Belonging Beyond Settler Sex & Nature.” Imaginations, vol. 10, no. 1, 2019, pp. 5–15. DOI dx.doi.org/10.17742/ IMAGE.CR.10.1.1
         <br>Kim TallBear and Angela Wiley introduce a collection of writings that challenge normative, settler-colonial modes of relation, sex and gender as well as anthropocentric and hierarchical constructions of nature. This piece introduces key conceptual issues shared between theories of queerness, posthumanism and indigeneity.

         The Matrix. Directed by Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski, Warner Brothers, 1999.
         <br>For us, The Matrix is exemplary of the following: a creative project birthed from queer and philosphical considerations which continues to perform long-lasting effects on mainstream culture; the importance of committing to a subversive cause while living under technocapitalism; the devastating effects of a sequel; the peculiar comfort of wearing sunglasses in any and all situations.
