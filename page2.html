      Queerness is a collective fabulation. To be queer is speculative, because it is experienced fleetingly, in microscopic suggestions. Queerness really isn't anything in particular, because it is a rare sign without any kind of referent other than the people who think they have thought the same thing at one point. Queerness is a conversation, where the topic is recalibrated with every exchange; where confrontation is nurtured, not as a means to convince another of the rightness of one opinion over another, but to produce creative alternatives. Conclusion becomes hollow. Anarchy was never invented by anyone and so it bears no one’s name.

      Queerness is a concern for means: Monica writes, “I think I have been frustrated with the repetitive insistence that we define queer because I think that queerness must be embodied.” Embodiment is the consensus of means and ends. Embodiment is and proceeds emergence. To embody is to create an improvisation, a moment of fabulation in which an alternative may be glimpsed or otherwise missed. Queerness is the consensus of these fabulations. To be queer is speculative, because it is experienced fleetingly, in microscopic suggestions.

After all, queerness is not a theory of the future.
